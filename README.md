### Description
This project is a simple landing page for Ebac Motors. It allows users to click on the hamburger menu and also directs users when they click on "Tenho Interesse" to the Contact portion of the form at the bottom.

#### JQuert
- The animate() method is used to create custom animations. In the example, it animates the scrollTop property of the html and body elements.
  
- scrollTop: $('#contato').offset().top: This sets the scrollTop position of the page to the top offset of the element with the ID contato.
  
- slideToggle() toggles between sliding the element up and down

#### CSS Concepts Implemented:
- Layout with Flexbox: display: flex; is used to create a flex container for the header list, allowing for easy horizontal centering and alignment of items.

- Responsive Design: @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} defines styles that apply only to screens with a maximum width of 600px, adjusting the width of form inputs and buttons for smaller screens.

- Styling Elements: Various CSS properties like background-color, color, padding, margin, and border are used to style different elements of the application such as the header, form, task items, buttons, and footer.

- Box Sizing: box-sizing: border-box; is used to include the padding and border in the element's total width and height, ensuring consistent sizing calculations.

- Positioning: position: absolute; bottom: 0; is used to position the footer at the bottom of the page, regardless of the content's height.
